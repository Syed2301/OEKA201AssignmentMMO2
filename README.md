## Confirmation
### Part 1
JÃ¸rn I. Halvorsen (confirmed)
### Part 2
Technically fine now (I have also made some adjustment).
Remaining task:
  - More output from  the R script should be embedded into the text [link](https://github.com/joernihHIOF/OEKA201SandboxJIH/blob/main/assignment/assignmentQandA.R)

Note: In order for the word counter to work (the function is located under the R folder), you need to execute (1) build and (2) install in RStudio before running assignment.qmd.
